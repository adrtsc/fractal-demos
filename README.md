## October Demo 2022
In October 2022, we demo Fractal for the Liberali lab and the Pelkmans lab. You can find the slides here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1j8xYRD_HP99sADttjsBzjjTr74oiveM-e6HAdDW0Sso/edit#slide=id.p
All the instructions for the demo are in the `demo-october-2022` folder. General instructions on installation and how things work are in the base folder, the `example_2x2_cardio_fmi` \ `example_2x2_cardio_uzh` contain the more details instructions.
